The clock and the calendar applications have been a key part of computing since
the beginning, and even before the GUI (DOS) Since this operating system is made
to revolutionize, and make maximum customization abilities, the clock had to be
redone. We have made the clock even more powerful than before, and to the point
where it can be used as a toy. The clock goes through time so far that you can
have a good laugh, or view certain events, and theories from those time periods.
You can play around with the time, however, make sure to create a restore point
first
